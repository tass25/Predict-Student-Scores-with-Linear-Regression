#### Goal: ###### Predict the score based on hours studied using linear regression.
#### Tools: ######  Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
## Steps:
##### Import Libraries: For data manipulation, plotting, and machine learning.
##### Create Dataset: Convert data into a Pandas DataFrame.
##### Split Data: Divide data into training and testing sets.
##### Train Model: Use linear regression to train the model with training data.
##### Get Coefficients: Extract the model’s intercept and coefficient to form the regression equation.
##### Make Predictions: Predict the score for a student studying 9.25 hours/day.
##### Visualize Results: Plot actual data points and the regression line.
##### Environment: This analysis is performed using JupyterLite.
