## Goal 🎯
Predict the score based on hours studied using linear regression.

## Tools 🛠️
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

## Steps 📝
1. **Import Libraries**: For data manipulation, plotting, and machine learning.
2. **Create Dataset**: Convert data into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Split Data**: Divide data into training and testing sets.
4. **Train Model**: Use linear regression to train the model with training data.
5. **Get Coefficients**: Extract the model’s intercept and coefficient to form the regression equation.
6. **Make Predictions**: Predict the score for a student studying 9.25 hours/day.
7. **Visualize Results**: Plot actual data points and the regression line.
8. **Environment**: This analysis is performed using JupyterLite.
